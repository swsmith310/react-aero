# react-aero

A collection of React components inspired by the Frutiger Aero aesthetic reminiscient of the late 2000s/early 2010s. The components are designed with a naming scheme matching that of Material UI for clarity and comfort sake, however they are built entirely from the ground up and there is no dependency on MUI or any other external libraries other than React itself.
